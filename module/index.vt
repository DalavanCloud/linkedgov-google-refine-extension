    <h1>LinkedGov Extension</h1>
    
    <p>The LinkedGov extension for Google Refine is aimed at non-technical users that may have a high level of expertise regarding 
    the semantics of their data, but are ultimately non-technical and would otherwise struggle with some of the processes and methods offered by GRefine.</p>
