	<h2>Address wizard</h2>

	<p class="description">
		The address wizard will attempt to understand and format any address information in the data. 
		An address may be contained within a single column (with the various parts split by comma for example) 
		or an address could have it's parts split across multiple columns.
	</p>

	<p class="description">
		If a multi-part address is contained in a single column, select the "Split address" box 
		below to split the address before selecting it's various parts. Once the address parts are 
		in their own columns, you may then select those columns and specify what parts of the address 
		they contain.

		"Street, District, City", you can specify what type of character (",")
		to split the column by.</span>
