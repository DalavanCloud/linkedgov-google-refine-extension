	<h2>Multiple columns wizard</h2>

	<p class="description">This wizard aims to move related values of
		the same type (i.e. times or measurements) in multiple columns into
		one single column.</p>
	<p class="description">
	<a class="ex">Example</a>
	<span class="ex-text">
 		An example could be a range of time columns
		containing energy readings for each hour, starting at "00:00" and
		finishing at "23:00", which could be reorganised into two columns -
		"Time" (which would contain the times) and "Readings" (which would
		contain the readings for each time).  
	</span>
	</p>	
		
	<p class="description">To begin the wizard, use the two drop-down
		lists to select a start and end for the range of columns. You can also
		remove columns from the range if you think they should be skipped
		before the wizard begins.</p>
